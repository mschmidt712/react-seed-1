# react-seed

A seed / starter repo for React based UI applications

## Project Layout

An overview of important files and configurations for the applications

### Root Files ('dot' files)

Also know as 'dot' files, these are the build and build configuration files for the application

 * <i>bin/</i> - shell scripts for continuous integration and build environments
 * <i>.babelrc</i> - configuration file for Babel preproccessor
 * <i>.editorconfig</i> - configuration file for EditorConfig IDE plugin
 * <i>.eslintr</i>c - linting rules for spec and build files
 * <i>package.json</i> - NPM / Yarn dependency configuration file, for
 build related dependencies and defines all runnable scripts and commands

## Project Setup
Note: It is recommended that a Javascript based IDE is used, like Webstorm, as they have a lot of the code quality and syntax tooling supported as plugins, often times right out of the box.

### Steps

1. If you don't already have it, download and install NodeJS >=6.4.0 (comes with NPM).

1. This project favors Yarn, so make sure you have the latest by updating
it after installing Node by running

  ```
  $ npm install -g yarn@0.24.6
  ```

1. Now install the build and application dependencies by running

  ```
  $ yarn install
  ```

### Application Files

 Application code, including unit tests. Directories are intended to be
 kept as flat as possible with a B.O.F. (birds of a feather) organization.

└───folder2

    │   file022.txt
```

## Dependency Management
All dependencies added or removed from the project must be done so through yarn

### Add
```bash
# use --dev if it as devDependency
$ yarn add <package-name> [--dev]
```

### Remove
```
$ yarn remove <package-name>
```

### Upgrade
```
$ yarn upgrade <package-name>
```
